/* Cents are from -100 to 100.

 * a degree between 50 and 130 in a logarithmic scale.
 *
 * This is what we are actually doing:
 * - If cents is 0, just leave it to 0 without any computation
 * - Compute the absolute value of the cents: -100 - 100 => 0 - 100
 * - Compute the logarithm in a precomputed base of the absolute value of the cents,
 *   so that we obtain a value from 0 to 40 in a logarithmic scale
 * - If the number was negative, make it negative again
 * - Finally, add the base degree (90Â°), so that we have a final degree between 50 and 130
